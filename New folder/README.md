VR Playground Demo

Welcome to my first VR Playground! This project is an experimental demo to see how many fun and interactive games I could create using basic physics interactions in VR.

Games You Can Play:

Basketball: Score points by throwing the ball through the hoop.

Baseball (sort of): Swing the bat and hit the ball.

Bowling: Knock down pins with the bowling ball.

Stack Cubes: Test your dexterity by building towers with cubes.

Marksmanship: Aim and shoot targets to test your accuracy.

Known Bugs:

Teleportation: Teleport doesn't work when the controller is aimed at low angles (aim higher to teleport farther).

Vignette Switcher: The vignette toggle works but can be finicky at times.

Bat Reset: The baseball bat doesn't reset properly after use.

Future Plans:

This has been an incredibly fun project to build, and I’m excited to keep improving it! Here's what I plan to do next:

Fine-tune the gameplay mechanics for all the games to make them feel more polished.

Add immersive audio effects for each game.

Fix the teleportation bug to improve movement.

Make the vignette switcher more reliable.

Improve item resetting to ensure smoother game flow.

Thanks so much for checking out my VR Playground demo! I hope you enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it.
